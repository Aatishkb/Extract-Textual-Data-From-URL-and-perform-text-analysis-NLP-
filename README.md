# Extract-Textual-Data-From-URL-and-perform-text-analysis-NLP-


## Objective
The objective of this project is to extract textual data from articles available at given URLs and perform text analysis to compute specified variables.

## Task
For each extracted article text, perform textual analysis to compute the variables listed below. Save the results in the format specified in `Output Data Structure.xlsx`.

### Variables
Definitions for each variable can be found in the `Text Analysis.docx` file:
1. **POSITIVE SCORE**: Measures the presence of positive words in the text.
2. **NEGATIVE SCORE**: Measures the presence of negative words in the text.
3. **POLARITY SCORE**: A measure of the overall sentiment of the text, calculated as the difference between the positive and negative scores.
4. **SUBJECTIVITY SCORE**: Indicates how subjective or objective the text is, based on the use of personal opinions, emotions, or judgments.
5. **AVG SENTENCE LENGTH**: The average number of words per sentence in the text.
6. **PERCENTAGE OF COMPLEX WORDS**: The proportion of words in the text that are complex (having three or more syllables).
7. **FOG INDEX**: A readability test that estimates the years of formal education needed to understand the text on a first reading.
8. **AVG NUMBER OF WORDS PER SENTENCE**: The average number of words per sentence.
9. **COMPLEX WORD COUNT**: The total count of complex words in the text.
10. **WORD COUNT**: The total number of words in the text.
11. **SYLLABLE PER WORD**: The average number of syllables per word in the text.
12. **PERSONAL PRONOUNS**: The count of personal pronouns (I, we, you, he, she, they, etc.) in the text.
13. **AVG WORD LENGTH**: The average length of words in the text, calculated by the number of characters.

# Sentiment-Analysis

## Objective
The goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on textual data, identifying the sentiment conveyed in the text as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Task
Using a dataset of textual data, this project aims to:
1. Preprocess the text data.
2. Apply sentiment analysis techniques to classify the sentiment of each text.
3. Evaluate the performance of the sentiment analysis model.
4. Visualize the results.

### Features
The key features of this sentiment analysis project include:
1. **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the text data for analysis by removing noise, tokenizing, and normalizing.
2. **Sentiment Classification**: Classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment using machine learning or lexicon-based methods.
3. **Performance Evaluation**: Measure the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the sentiment analysis model.
4. **Result Visualization**: Create visualizations to display the distribution of sentiments and the performance metrics of the model.

### Usage
1. **Preprocess Text**: Clean and prepare the text data.
2. **Train Model**: Train the sentiment analysis model on the preprocessed data.
3. **Evaluate Model**: Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.
4. **Visualize Results**: Generate visualizations to interpret the results.
